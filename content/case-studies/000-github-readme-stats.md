title: A Tetris AutoPlayer
excerpt:
  I redesigned the classic retro Tetris game- changing its GUI and some of its gameplay- and wrote a Genetic Algorithm for an auto-player.

Hey guys! i hope you are doing well.

Yesterday after seeing that lot of people on twitter are creating their Github
profile Readmes i thought i should do something cool & unique, so i created this
->

### Github Readme Stats

[![Github Readme Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=anuraghazra&repo=github-readme-stats)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

Github readme stats allows you to simply add a markdown image link and it will
show you realtime stats for your github account.

```md
![Anurag's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=anuraghazra)
```

And the cool thing is since it's just an image you can embed it anywhere even on
any websites!

Live Demo:

Pretty neat isn't it? Try it out right now on your profile readme too! :D

After seeing that people liked the `Github Stats Card` idea i created
`Github Extra Pins`

### Github Extra Pins

Github extra pins allows you to pin more than 6 repositories in your profile by
using github readme profile.

**Yey! you are no longer limited to 6 pinned repos**

```md

```

Live demo:

Check out the
[docs to learn more](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats#github-extra-pins)

That's it :D I hope you guys liked the project. And make sure to give it a star
on [Github](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)
